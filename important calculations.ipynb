      "\n",
      "### What is Pan card?\n",
      "\n",
      "The PAN card is a unique ten-digit alphanumeric identification number that is issued by the Income Tax Department of India to track the tax-related transactions of individuals and entities. The PAN card is mandatory for any financial transaction in India, including opening a bank account, buying or selling property, and filing income tax returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Who needs a Pan card?\n",
      "\n",
      "All individuals/non-individuals (including foreign citizens/entities) earning taxable income in India must have a PAN card.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of PAN cards\n",
      "\n",
      "In India, two types of PAN cards are available: e-PAN card and physical PAN card.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. e-PAN card: An e-PAN card is a digitally-signed PAN card issued in electronic format. It contains the same PAN details as a physical PAN card but is available in a digital format. It can be downloaded online and used as a valid identification document for various purposes. The e-PAN card is usually issued in a PDF format.\n",
      "2. Physical PAN card: A physical PAN card is a laminated card with your PAN details printed on it. It is a physical document that can be carried and used as a valid identification proof. The physical PAN card is sent to the applicant's registered address by post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both e-PAN and physical PAN cards have the same validity and can be used for identification purposes. The choice between the two depends on the applicant's preference and requirements.\n",

      "Both e-PAN and physical PAN cards have the same validity and can be used for identification purposes. The choice between the two depends on the applicant's preference and requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Why do NRIs need PAN card?**\n",
      "\n",
      "NRIS don’t need to have a PAN Card. However, a PAN Card is necessary for NRIs if they wish to do any of the following in India:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A PAN card is required to carry out financial transactions such as opening a bank account, investing in stocks, purchasing or selling property, and investing in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If an NRI earns an income in India, they must file income tax returns. A PAN card is necessary to file these returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If an NRI wants to invest in mutual funds in India, they must have a PAN card.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Importance of PAN card for different NRI account options\n",
      "\n",
      "NRI Accounts comprise of NRE,NRO and FCNR Accounts. A basic overview to understand the importance of PAN Card with respect to these three accounts can be understood as:\n",
      "\n",
      "**NRE:** For funds earned outside India where both Principal and Interest earned are tax-free. Therefore, NRIs can opt for Form 60, which is a substitute for PAN for opening an NRE Account.\n",
